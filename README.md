# Welcome to 5D Tools Summer I 2018

## How to upload your homework:

1. Make sure that your `index.html` file, your `style.css`, and any other files are within a folder named `LASTNAME - Week #`
  For example:
  ```
  Larsson - Week 1
  ```
  
2. When you're ready to upload, go into the folder for the current week, and click on `Upload Files` (near the green button on the right).


3. Upload your entire folder with your name on it (makes it way easier for me to grade things and scan who has handed things in!)


4. I purposely protected the repo so that you can't just commit without a pull request. Make sure to check the box that says `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.`
  This ensures that I can leave feedback on your assignment.
  
5. On this new page, you don't have to enter a description or anything, but make sure to click `Open a pull request`


6. You're done! You'll see a new page with some red error `x`s that looks like this:
