# Welcome to 5D Tools Summer I 2018

## How to upload your homework:

1. Make sure that your `index.html` file, your `style.css`, and any other files are within a folder named `LASTNAME - Week #`
  For example:
  ```
  Larsson - Week 1
  ```
2. When you're ready to upload, click on `Upload Files` (near the green button on the right).

3. Upload your entire folder with your name on it (otherwise I won't know who's files they are and you won't get credit)

4. Make sure to check the box that says `Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.`
  This ensures that I can leave feedback on your assignment.
